# Elevator Operation Data Documentation

This document describes the elevator operation dataset exported from the Group Control System (GCS). 
The dataset consists of 6 CSV files recording information about elevator calls, operation, stops, door status, and load changes.

## 1. Dataset Overview

**File List:**
1. `hall_calls.csv`: Records hall call signals (people pressing up/down buttons in the elevator lobby).
2. `car_calls.csv`: Records car call signals (people pressing floor buttons inside the elevator car).
3. `car_stops.csv`: Records the time when an elevator stops at a floor and the reason for stopping.
4. `car_departures.csv`: Records the time when an elevator departs from a floor.
5. `load_changes.csv`: Records load change data when passengers enter or exit the elevator.
6. `maintenance_mode.csv`: Records when elevators enter or exit maintenance mode.

## 2. Common Field Descriptions

All files contain the following basic fields：
*   **Time**：The specific timestamp when the event occurred, precise to seconds, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`。(Note that Excel does not directly display seconds when opened. Seconds are visible only when clicking on a cell, using text editing, or opening the data with a program.)
*   **Elevator ID**: The unique identifier for the elevator (e.g., `A`、`B`、`C`、`D`)。
*   **Floor**：The floor number where the event occurred, starting from `1`。
